This repository is a hub for all information regarding PE2 and how to contribute to the project(s)  
Have a question, idea or just have something to say? [Start a discussion](https://github.com/tm-pe2/meta/discussions/new)

## Getting started

In order to get full access to repo's, you need to be a member of the organization. To join the organisation ping `Xunafay#0001` or `Toast#1042` with your github username, you'll receive an invite link on your github email.

Once you've gained access to the organisation, you should join your teams:
- [AI](https://github.com/orgs/tm-pe2/teams/ai)
- [App Dev](https://github.com/orgs/tm-pe2/teams/app-dev)
- [SSS]()
- [DevOps](https://github.com/orgs/tm-pe2/teams/devops)

SSS Team still needs to be made by any member on the SSS team.

## Help I'm new to Git and GitHub

## Task Management

To track your work it is highly recommended to [create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) describing your task. This way there is an immutable history of what you've done.  
[Assign yourself to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users) to indicate to others your already working on it.

Here are some tips on using issues to organize your work better:

1. Split tasks into smaller, more manageable issues. [Use a task list to track these related issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-task-lists).
3. Use the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/tm-pe2/projects/1) to track and organize tasks.
4. Use a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to close an issue and tracks its code.
5. Use labels to describe and organize issues.

## How to contribute code

Do not contribute to the main branch always create a new branch (optionally on a fork) and create a pull request.  
This is called the GitHub flow. A [complete guide can be found here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

## Tools that will help you

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is an editor that supports many languages with the use of extensions.  
VSCode has a built in Git tab used to see differences in files and commit changes.
