## Task Management

Task management done properly is important to the success of any project.
In order to ensure successful teamwork and task management, the following guidelines are recommended:

1. Split tasks into smaller, more manageable issues. [Use a task list to track these related issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-task-lists).
2. Assign yourself to a task so other people know someone is working on it.
3. Use the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/tm-pe2/projects/1) to track and organize tasks.
4. Use a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to close an issue.
5. Use labels to describe and organize issues.

## How to contribute code

Do not contribute to the main branch always create a new branch (optionally on a fork) and create a pull request.  
This is called the GitHub flow. A [complete guide can be found here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
